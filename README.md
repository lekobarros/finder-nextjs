# finder-next (project in alpha)
This application was made for a personal project for training in React and Next with Typescript and GSAP for micro UI interactions. 

I based this project on my first personal project named Finder, that the proposal was a build one page without frameworks with only HTML, CSS animations, and JavaScript to control the DOM. The project consists of a simple interactive music match effect inspired by MusiXMatch's app for Android and iOS devices.
